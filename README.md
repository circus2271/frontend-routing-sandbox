let's assume: it not a 100% hard developer made 100% best standarts code

it's rather a somewhat evening beginner experiense to try write someting bigger than a todolist...

not 100% best developer experiene if a developer experience at all

that said, the probably features are:

single page app -> so all routes are handled by client side javascript

navigation without page reload


it well be some kind of a blog, where users can login through firebase (google, and maybe some other auth providers)

so, a user may have his own feed, a page to create posts, and each post would have a comment section. only registered users may create.. such posts and leave comments

a post may contain header top image and titles and sections filled with text

a header image may be animated with parallax on scroll. this could be disabled in settings


when not logged in user leaves a comment, a comment saves in local memory and a user is prompted to register. after that, he redirects back to comment section (page with that comments) and a comment is prefilled from memory.. and maybe even submitted at once


a user may have his own page, where it will be a feed of posts, and also a comments tab. with a comments from this user accordingly

it may also have an edit section, where an user could delete his profile, edit his name or avatar



maybe a post may have tags and there maybe will be a tags page. but it seems like a redundant page by now
